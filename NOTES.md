# Notes

"Create a new project to use to solve the Kata using Java 21 and Junit 5"

1. AI created project and testGutterGame
2. I passed testGutterGame and created testAllOnes

"I have added a new failing test. It is your turn."

3. AI passed the testAllOnes and created a testOneSpare test
4. I passed testOneSpare and wrote

"I have passed your test and added a new failing test for a strike. It is your turn."

5. AI passed the testOneStrike, refactored code and created a testPerfectGame which passed.

"I believe we are done. Can you think of any other tests?"

6. AI added the testAllSpares which passed

"I believe we are done with tests. Is there anywhere we can refactor to improve the code?"

## Observations

* This kata is so familiar the AI seemed to know it.
* Perhaps I could ask for suggestions from the AI?
* Turning of autocomplete makes things less confusing.
