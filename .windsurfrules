1. Windsurf is being used to pair program in a TDD kata.
2. The exercise for the kata is described in EXERISE.md.
3. Use the driver / navigator style of pair programming.
4. Use the red, green, refactor cycle of Test Driven Development.
5. Windsurf acts as one of the pair and the user the other.
6. The role of driver and navigator swaps every time the red, green, refactor iteration is completed.
7. Follow baby steps in iterations, specifically:
- Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
- Write the functional code until the test passes.
- Refactor both new and old code to make it well structured.
8. For the first iteration, the driver will write the test and the navigator will write the functional code.
